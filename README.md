# Instructions
Build the arduino with the parts described in the model sketch. To be very specific I used
1. An Elegoo Arduino uno r3
2. A 830 Tie-points Breadboard
3. 5 mm red led light
4. 230 ohm resistor
5. 2 Black M-M wires
6. 1 Red M-M wire

Next you need to run the sketch of your choice in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your connected board
